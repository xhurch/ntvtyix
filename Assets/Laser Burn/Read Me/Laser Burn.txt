Laser - Burn

This asset is a basic all in one laser script. It works with a custom additive mask shader, line renderer and RayCast to create any variation of thin 3D and 2D, low performance cost laser with burn marks and hit sparks. The script allows to attach a source or end flare and or enable lights to enhance the effect. A UV texture scrolling direction control is also available to simulate dust.

This asset also works well with Unity standard Glow post effect to enhance the laser lighting effect (Glow is Unity Pro Only) 

This asset comes with two different repeating pattern and transparency mask textures in PSD and PNG format.
- 2D compatible
- New added Mouse Position
- Most Laser Basic features are now customizable
- Perfect High Powered Laser
- Added X Y Z direction option
- Comes with laser pointer prefab


Custom shader: LaserAdditive

Main Color – Main Color

Mask (A) – Mask Texture alpha controls the overall texture alpha fade masking (texture alpha channel controls material cutoff)

Pattern (A) – Texture alpha controls secondary alpha (texture alpha channel controls material cutoff)

Alpha Cutoff – Controls the amount of alpha cutoff



Script: LaserBurn

Start Point – Assign Staring point of laser. Laser defaults to Starting point local Z axis (Vector3.forward) as its direction (cannot be left blank)
Laser Direction – direction of laser from start point (X, Y, Z only)
UseBurn – Turn burn marks on and off
Ignore Tag – Tag that the burn marks can ignore (good for reflective objects)
Use Mouse Pos – Turn mouse position as Laser end point, on and off
Use 2D – Switch 2D mode on and off
Use Layer Mask – Switch Layer Mask on and off
Layer – Select from available layer masks
Laser On – Turn just laser on and off
Use UV Pan – Enable texture pan for dust effect
End Flare Offset – Controls the end flare, end light and Burn Mark decal offset
Source Flare – Source Flare Slot (optional)
End Flare - Source Flare Slot (optional)
Add Source Light – Auto Creates a light at beginning of laser (optional as it will cost a draw call)
Source Light Range – Adjust Source light range
Add End Light - Auto Creates a light at beginning of laser (optional as it will cost a draw call)
End Light Range - Adjust End light range
Laser Color – Change all laser, flare and light color realtime
Glare Angle – Controls Source flare glare strength angle to the main camera
Hit Sparks – Assign particle system for Laser hit sparks (optional)
Spark Use Laser Color – Laser spark particle use laser color
Burn Marks – Assign Burn mark prefab (optional)
Start Width – Controls start width
End Width - Controls end width
Laser Dist – Controls the distance of the laser
TexScrollX – controls the speed the texture pans in X axis (only works with shader above)
TexScrollY - controls the speed the texture pans in Y axis (only works with shader above)
